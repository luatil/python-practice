A Graph G is a set of vertices V and edges E.

Degree - degree(v) is equal to the number of edges connect to v

Path - sequence of vertices connected by edges

Cycle - path that starts and ends at the same vertex - all cycles are paths but not all paths are cycles

Connectivity - two vertices are connected if a path exists between them
  A graph is connected when all vertices are connected

Connected(v1, v2) - v1 and v2 are connected if there a path between them

Connected(Graph) - A graph is connected when all vertices are connected 

Connected Component - a subset of vertices in v_i in V that is connected 

Types of graphs:
    Undirected Graph 
    Edge (u, v) implies (v, u)

Neighbors - vertices u and v are neighbous if an edge(u, v) connects them 

Trees:
    1. Connected and acyclic
    2. Removing edge disconnects graph
    3. Adding edge creates a cycle
